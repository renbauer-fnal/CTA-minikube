CERN has purchased LTO-8 tape drives that we have started to use with LTO-8 and LTO-7 type M media.
While LTO is attractive in terms of cost/TB, it lacks functionality for fast positioning available on
enterprise drives, such as a high-resolution tape directory and drive-assisted file access ordering
(aka RAO). In this contribution, we will outline our experiences with LTO so far, describe performance
measurements and our current investigations on how to improve positioning times.
