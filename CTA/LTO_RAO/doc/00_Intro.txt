Background information on LTO and SW RAO
========================================

01 As a primer, I recommend you to go over the HEPiX Fall 2018 slides on the topic (cf link).

02 Then, have a look at the Request Sense SCSI command (cf attached manual on page 157), bytes 29 and
   30-33 that provide the current wrap, direction and position of the head.

03 In the mail below, you will find the command line sg_requests commands that allow to read out this
   information (Kudos to Vlado).

   We characterised some 150 LTO7/LTO8 tapes (see under /afs/cern.ch/project/castor/tape/tests/LTO/physmapfiles)
   by reading them from beginning to end and extracting for each tape segment the following information
   (see also the README.TXT in that directory):

   <fseq1> <wrap ID> <LPOS> <block id (dec)> separated by (one or more) spaces

   the tape verification system (tape-verify) was enhanced to read these files and to use them for
   implementing a proof-of-concept RAO. It supports the traversal algorithms described in the HEPiX
   presentation. The Perl source code can be found here. tape-verify does many, many things so I
   recommend you to just concentrate on the proof-of-concept positioning and the traversal algorithms:

   The most interesting function is the following: position_cost(fseq1, fseq2) that computes the cost
   to go from fseq1 to fseq2, and that takes into account the coefficients described in slide 23 of the
   HEPiX slide. This is the function that would need to be implemented in CTA in order to be able to
   establish the best recall order of a set of fseqs. The values of the coefficients are slightly
   different as they were updated after the HEPiX slides, but the coefficients themselves still apply.

   The other interesting functions are the ones implementing the different traversal algorithms, namely
   fseq_reorder_*. The most efficient one (shortest locate time first aka pivot-based travelling salesman
   implementation) is fseq_reorder_sltf().

   The only real remaining problem to be solved for CTA is how to extract positioning information when
   writing the tape, and how reliable that information is as there is a 1GB buffer in the tape drive.
   I recommend you to get a (real) tape and drive, and start by writing segments to the tape in immediate
   (non-flushing) mode, and reading back the position of the head after every segment has been written.
   Then, rewind the tape, and for every segment, read it back (to /dev/null) and get the head position
   after each segment read. Last, compare the positions obtained for each of the segments and see whether
   there is an offset (and how big it is, maybe 1GB worth of physical space or 1/60th of a wrap). This
   offset would then need to be taken into account when recording the LPOS information in the name server.

   I’m happy to provide further details, maybe it would be good if you have a first look and then we get
   together in front of a whiteboard for details!

   cheers, Germán

   Note that for the L7 tapes above, we established physical mappings including wrap, LPOS and block
   ID for each of the segments:

      /afs/cern.ch/project/castor/tape/tests/LTO/physmapfiles/LTO-7M/LXXXXX.pmap

   So these suit well for comparisons. For LTO, there are a handful under ../LTO-8 but none of them
   are validation tapes.

   cheers, Germán
