\chapter{CTA Authorization}

\section{\glspl{sss}}

\glspl{sss} are used to authenticate communications using the XRoot protocol, which is the case in the following
situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Internal communication between the EOS \texttt{mgm} and \texttt{fst} daemons.
\item Communication between the Tape Server and the EOS \texttt{mgm} daemon. (On the other hand, communication between
the Tape Server and the EOS \texttt{fst} daemon does not use SSS; this is handled by internal redirection within the
XRoot library layer.)
\item Communication between the EOS \texttt{mgm} daemon and the CTA Front End daemon.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Kerberos}

Kerberos authentication is used in the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communication between the CTA Admin tool and the CTA Front End daemon. In this case, Kerberos is the only available
authentication mechanism.
\item Communication between EOS users (Atlas, CMS, etc.) and the EOS \texttt{mgm} daemon. In this case, Kerberos is one
of several options. Authentication can be performed by any mechanism which is supported by both XRoot and EOS, for
example SSS or standard UNIX authentication.
\end{enumerate}
